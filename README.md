Game description:

We are planning to make a text-based role-playing game, and the concept of this game is similar to the Pokemon game, where the player will be able to go around the map, which in our case, is just a simple 2D map, to complete a variety of missions. In each of these missions, the player will be confronted with different opponents in a battlefield, and in order for the player to pass that mission, he/she has to defeat all the opponents before his/her in-game HP drops to zero. The purpose of these missions is to allow the player to improve their character's overall stats, as the player will be rewarded with useful items like new creatures, in-game money or equipments if he/she is able to complete these given missions. All these missions also serve to prepare the player to face the last and biggest battle of our game, which is the "final boss". The game is completed when the player has successfully defeated the "final boss".
