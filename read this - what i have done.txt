what i have done:
1. written functions to print battle field
2. written function to deploy creature in battle
3. written function to attack in battle
4. worked out overall battle framework (store deployed creature in linked list, remove when dead etc.)

what i havent done:
1. write function to use card in battle
2. write function (code function) to carry out the function (uses) of the cards
3. write function to print out battle results (determine the rewards etc)
4. write AI as opponent
5. write some code to delay the output (cuz the output come out a bit too fast the player may miss what happens)
6. write some code to display your creature attacking the opponent's creature

U can run 'battletest' to try the battle if you are using Linux.
run 'test.exe' if using windows
idk if 'battletest' can run on macOS

for now u can only deploy a creature on battlefield or attack using a creature.
and for now the battle is pvp cuz i havent written the AI
if u run 'battletest', u can play against urself, but its a bit boring at this stage cuz all you can do is attack nia
to deploy: type "deploy <creature number on the left side of screen> <position>" position: deploy as the second creature among ur creatures, position = 2
to attack: type "attack <target creature name> with <own creature name>
