I created a class to store cards and another class creatures and defined some necessary member functions
I have also written two txt files to store the list of all cards and creatures in game
please read xia and understand how the class is structured so u can use it in ur menu
the Makefile provides codes to compile the classes and headers into an executable file "test", the "test" is just to test the correctness of my code la
